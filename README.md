# PSSharp.PowerShell.FSharpCore
This module is designed as a carrier of the FSharp.Core assembly, specifically to remove the need for packaging FSharp.Core
with any module that references the assembly. There is no actual code or anything here; just build and release scripts to
update the module in the PSGallery.
